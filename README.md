`test-helpers` is a library that adds some missing functionality to [terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).




## Introduction

`test-helpers` is a library that adds some missing functionality to [terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

`test-helpers` includes functionality for:

   - Destroying all resources in an AWS account after a test run using [aws-nuke](https://github.com/ekristen/aws-nuke)
   - Running tests with [atmos](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos) stack configs
   - Running tests on components (Terraform root modules) that follow the Cloud Posse standards for implementation


## Install

Install the latest version in your go tests

```console
go get github.com/cloudposse/test-helpers
```

Get a specific version

```console
go get github.com/cloudposse/test-helpers@v0.0.1
```

## Usage

You can use `test-helpers` as a library in your own Go test code along with the `terratest` library.

## Packages

### pkg/atmos

This library is designed to be used with [atmos](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos) to allow you to run tests with
different stack configurations. For example, imagine you have a component that you want to test to make sure it applies
properly and that the output contains "Hello, World". Below shows how you could run a test from an atmos stack.

```go
func TestApplyNoError(t *testing.T) {
  t.Parallel()

  testFolder, err := files.CopyTerraformFolderToTemp("../../test/fixtures/atmos", t.Name())
  require.NoError(t, err)
  defer os.RemoveAll(testFolder)

  fmt.Printf("running in %s\n", testFolder)

  options := WithDefaultRetryableErrors(t, &Options{
    AtmosBasePath: testFolder,
    Component:     "terraform-no-error",
    Stack:         "test-test-test",
    NoColor:       true,
  })

  out := Apply(t, options)

  require.Contains(t, out, "Hello, World")
}
```

### pkg/aws-nuke

This package is designed to be used to destroy all resources created by a test in an AWS account after a test run
using [aws-nuke](https://github.com/ekristen/aws-nuke).

```go
func TestAwsNuke(t *testing.T) {
  t.Parallel()
  randID := strings.ToLower(random.UniqueId())

  rootFolder := "../../"
  terraformFolderRelativeToRoot := "examples/awsnuke-example"
  tempTestFolder := testStructure.CopyTerraformFolderToTemp(t, rootFolder, terraformFolderRelativeToRoot)
  defer os.RemoveAll(tempTestFolder)

  terraformOptions := &terraform.Options{
      TerraformDir: tempTestFolder,
      Upgrade:      true,
      VarFiles:     []string{fmt.Sprintf("fixtures.%s.tfvars", testRegion)},
      Vars: map[string]interface{}{
        "attributes": []string{randID},
        "default_tags": map[string]string{
        terratestTagName: randID,
      },
   },
}
```

### pkg/atmos/component-helper

This package is designed to be used to test components (root modules) that follow the Cloud Posse convention for
terraform root modules.

For more information on using the `component-helper`, see the [component-helper README](pkg/atmos/component-helper/README.md).

## Examples

The [example](examples/) folder contains a full set examples that demonstrate the use of `test-helpers`:

  - [example](examples/awsnuke-example) folder contains a terraform module that can be used to test the `awsnuke`
  functionality. The test for this module is in [pkg/awsnuke/awsnuke_test.go](pkg/awsnuke/awsnuke_test.go). -
  [test/component-helper-integration](test/component-helper-integration) folder contains a terraform module and test
  that can be used to demonstrate the `component-helper` functionality.

## Running Terraform Tests

We use [Atmos](https://atmos.tools) to streamline how Terraform tests are run. It centralizes configuration and wraps common test workflows with easy-to-use commands.

All tests are located in the [`test/`](test) folder.

Under the hood, tests are powered by Terratest together with our internal [Test Helpers](https://github.com/cloudposse/test-helpers) library, providing robust infrastructure validation.

Setup dependencies:
- Install Atmos ([installation guide](https://atmos.tools/install/))
- Install Go [1.24+ or newer](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Install Terraform or OpenTofu

To run tests:

- Run all tests:  
  ```sh
  atmos test run
  ```
- Clean up test artifacts:  
  ```sh
  atmos test clean
  ```
- Explore additional test options:  
  ```sh
  atmos test --help
  ```
The configuration for test commands is centrally managed. To review what's being imported, see the [`atmos.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/.github/refs/heads/main/.github/atmos/terraform-module.yaml) file.

Learn more about our [automated testing in our documentation](https://docs.cloudposse.com/community/contribute/automated-testing/) or implementing [custom commands](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/custom-commands/) with atmos.
