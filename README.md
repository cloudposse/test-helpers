## Introduction


`terratest-helpers` is a library that adds some missing functionality to [terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

`terratest-helpers` includes functionality for:

   - Destroying all resources in an AWS account after a test run using [aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke)
   - Running tests with [atmos](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos) stack configs


## Install

Install the latest version in your go tests

```console
go install github.com/cloudposse/terratest-helpers
```

Get a specific version

```console
go install github.com/cloudposse/terratest-helpers@v0.0.1
```

## Usage

You can use `terratest-helpers` as a library in your own terratest code.

### atmos

This library is designed to be used with [atmos](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos) to allow you to run tests with
different stack configurations. For example, imagine you have a component that you want to test to make sure it applies
properly and that the coput contains "Hello, World". Below hows how you could run a test from an atmos stack.

```go
func TestApplyNoError(t *testing.T) {
  t.Parallel()

  testFolder, err := files.CopyTerraformFolderToTemp("test/my-test", t.Name())
  require.NoError(t, err)

  fmt.Printf("running in %s\n", testFolder)

  options := WithDefaultRetryableErrors(t, &Options{
    AtmosBasePath: testFolder,
    Component:     "terraform-no-error",
    Stack:         testStack,
    NoColor:       true,
  })

  out := Apply(t, options)

  require.Contains(t, out, "Hello, World")
}
```

### aws-nuke

```go
func TestApplyNoError(t *testing.T) {
  t.Parallel()

  testFolder, err := files.CopyTerraformFolderToTemp(atmosExamplePath, t.Name())
  require.NoError(t, err)

  fmt.Printf("running in %s\n", testFolder)

  options := WithDefaultRetryableErrors(t, &Options{
    AtmosBasePath: testFolder,
    Component:     "terraform-no-error",
    Stack:         testStack,
    NoColor:       true,
  })

  out := Apply(t, options)

  require.Contains(t, out, "Hello, World")
}
```


## Examples

The [example](examples/) folder contains a full set examples that demonstrate the use of `terratest-helpers`:

  - [example](examples/awsnuke-example) folder contains a terraform module that can be used to test the `awsnuke` functionality.
  The test for this module is in [pkg/awsnuke/awsnuke_test.go](pkg/awsnuke/awsnuke_test.go).
