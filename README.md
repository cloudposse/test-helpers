`test-helpers` is a library that adds some missing functionality to [terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Introduction

`test-helpers` is a library that adds some missing functionality to [terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

`test-helpers` includes functionality for:

- Destroying all resources in an AWS account after a test run using [aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke)
- Running tests with [atmos](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos) stack configs

## Install

Install the latest version in your go tests

```console
go install github.com/cloudposse/test-helpers
```

Get a specific version

```console
go install github.com/cloudposse/test-helpers@v0.0.1
```

## Usage

You can use `test-helpers` as a library in your own terratest code.

### atmos

This library is designed to be used with [atmos](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos) to allow you to run tests with
different stack configurations. For example, imagine you have a component that you want to test to make sure it applies
properly and that the coput contains "Hello, World". Below hows how you could run a test from an atmos stack.

```go
func TestApplyNoError(t *testing.T) {
  t.Parallel()

  testFolder, err := files.CopyTerraformFolderToTemp("../../test/fixtures/atmos", t.Name())
  require.NoError(t, err)
  defer os.RemoveAll(testFolder)

  fmt.Printf("running in %s\n", testFolder)

  options := WithDefaultRetryableErrors(t, &Options{
    AtmosBasePath: testFolder,
    Component:     "terraform-no-error",
    Stack:         "test-test-test",
    NoColor:       true,
  })

  out := Apply(t, options)

  require.Contains(t, out, "Hello, World")
}
```

### aws-nuke

```go
func TestAwsNuke(t *testing.T) {
  t.Parallel()
  randID := strings.ToLower(random.UniqueId())

  rootFolder := "../../"
  terraformFolderRelativeToRoot := "examples/awsnuke-example"
  tempTestFolder := testStructure.CopyTerraformFolderToTemp(t, rootFolder, terraformFolderRelativeToRoot)
  defer os.RemoveAll(tempTestFolder)

  terraformOptions := &terraform.Options{
      TerraformDir: tempTestFolder,
      Upgrade:      true,
      VarFiles:     []string{fmt.Sprintf("fixtures.%s.tfvars", testRegion)},
      Vars: map[string]interface{}{
        "attributes": []string{randID},
        "default_tags": map[string]string{
        terratestTagName: randID,
      },
   },
}
```

## Examples

The [example](examples/) folder contains a full set examples that demonstrate the use of `test-helpers`:

- [example](examples/awsnuke-example) folder contains a terraform module that can be used to test the `awsnuke` functionality.
  The test for this module is in [pkg/awsnuke/awsnuke_test.go](pkg/awsnuke/awsnuke_test.go).
